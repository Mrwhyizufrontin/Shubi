# Shubi
All in one shoe purchasing program.


I originally intended to turn this program into a business. However due to the nature of botting things that arent supposed to be botted, the program would require more work than I could put in to keep working by myself.
I no longer want to work on Shubi after putting in consistant effort for about 4-5 months and will be moving on to other projects.

Make sure to redifine the progaurd.conf path in pom.xml if you want to continue using maven to compile.


Because this program was originally intended to be sold, login verification is done server side. Currently the auth server is still online (4/19/17), however I'm not sure how much longer I will be paying for hosting.
The server code will be uploaded soon.
